        <h2>Background History</h2>
        <p>I'm mexican and columbian. So my dad is the one that is columbian and my mom is mexican. My sister is the same as me. My family and I love you travel to different places in the world when we have the chance. We go back to their home towns once in a while but wherever we go we will enjoy just being together. </p>
        <p>Things that I do in my life is not very exciting. All I do is wake up atend mostly all my zoom classes, play between the breaks that I have and then when the next class comes up I atend it and do the work. When all classes are done I go play for a little and then I go to back to work and I try to finish what I can. And then I go sleep and get ready for the next day. </p>
        <h2>Friends</h2>
        <p>My friends are the best. They are all different. I enjoy hanging out with them once awhile when I have time to but they make my das much better when I'm just not feeling right. I couldn't ask for better friends. </p>
